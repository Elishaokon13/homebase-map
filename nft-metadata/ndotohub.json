  "description": "This is a continuation of the Build with Base series. Continuing from where we stopped last year, builders are invited to attend this workshop to explore onchain autonomous agents.\n\nIn an era where we strive to automate literally everything, there has been no better time to decentralize autonomy than now. Autonomous agents not only have taken the world by storm but have also impacted our onchain interactions. What better way can we harness their power than to build and explore with our own...!\n\nAgenda.\n\nLearning Basics about AI Autonomous agents\n\nBuild a simple Agent.\n\nLearn to use the Agent Kit with other integrations.\n\nAs a cherry on top, we are gonna have a fun filled learning experience with merch and refreshments after, Agents are supposed to be fun afterall...see you there. The event is supported by Base and organized by Joel Ategyeka.\n\nAbout Base\n\nBase, incubated within Coinbase, is an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) network offering a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly way to build decentralized apps onchain.
